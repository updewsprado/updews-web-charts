- Indentation and code organization has improved.
- More indentation has to be implemented though. A sample of these are as follows:
1. about.html
	-> lines 17,18,19,30,42,46
	-> all elements inside element id "container"
	etc
2. i.js
	-> tabs for lines 19 & 21
3. mystyle.css
	-> looks organized but lets follow a format here:
	#nameOfHTMLelement {
		attribute1: value1;
		attr2: value2;
		attr3: value3;
	}
	-> choose that specific positioning for the brackets :)
4. home.html
	-> comments similar to "about.html"
5. location.html
	-> comments similar to "about.html"

- Its working but it needs major modifications

1.d. User Interface / User Experience
	- the dropdown has a tendency to close immediately. This is not good for user experience.
	- move the dropdown selection to the navigation bar.

2. Use "main.css" for your CSS and link it to your pages. This is standard practice for web development
	and should be made a habit as early as possible. :)

3. Make sure to implement proper indentations before moving to the next exercises. This will make
	the coding life of everyone that is part of a collaborative work (like github) a lot easier. :)
