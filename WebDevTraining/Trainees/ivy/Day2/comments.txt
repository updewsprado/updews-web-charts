1. Good job, the form is working. :)
2. Your code is missing "data storing" though. You need to store the code to either
	a file or to a local database.
3. Please remember to always remove lines of code that aren't part of the deliverables.
	This is a practice that should be made into a habit in order to make our
	collective code in github more readable and lean.
