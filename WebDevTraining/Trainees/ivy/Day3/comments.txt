Comment/s:

1. Good job, it is working as well. :)
2. For good code practice, please make it into a habit to put proper indentation to your code.
	Having proper indentation will make our collective code more readable. This is very
	important especially for times that debugging is needed for very lengthy codes.

Ex: (your current code)
<div id="top">
<h1>Header</h1>
</div>
<div id="leftnav">
<p>
SIDE BAR
</p>
</div>
<div id="content">
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<p>
A city car also known as urban car or mini is a small car intended primarily for urban areas and conurbations..
</p>
</div>

3. Bonus! Store your CSS into a file named "main.css" and link it to your home.html
